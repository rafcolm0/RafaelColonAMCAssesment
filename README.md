## NOTES:
 * Tech stack: Swift, Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, Kingfisher.
 * Application follows MVVM design pattern. There is one main view controller with its view model for the main tableview. And there is a dynamically assigned extended UITableViewCell that acts as the "view controller" for each gallery carousel cells, each with its own view model.  All data and service objects are also modular and separated from the View and View models.
 * Comments about edge cases, concerns and suggestions provided throughout the code.
