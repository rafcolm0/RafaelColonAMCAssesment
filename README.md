* Ressume attached to repo.

## NOTES:
 * Tech stack: Swift, Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, Kingfisher.
 * Application follows MVVM design pattern. There is one main view controller with its view model for the main tableview. And there a dynamically assigned extended UITableViewCell that's acts as the "view controller" for each gallery carousel cell, each with its own view model.  All data and service objects are also separated from the View and View models.
 * Comments for edge cases, concerns and suggestions provided throughout the code.
